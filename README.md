# Court reservation app

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.12.
The main intention behind this application is to demo [PrimeNG UI suite](https://primeng.org/) while providing the user with a simple application for court reservations. The other key-point was providing users with real-time information about court statuses through the websocket protocol and a high-performing database server like [Redis](https://redis.io/), though that is still very work in progress at the moment.

## Demoing the app
The app is deployed through Github Pages on this repository.
Simply log in with either: 
`user1` `password1` or
`user2` `password2` .

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
